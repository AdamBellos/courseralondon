If there is a sub-building, for example, the building is divided into flats, there will be a SAON; Street; Locality; Town/City; District; County.\n\nTo explore and target recommended locations across different venues according to the presence of amenities and essential facilities, we will access data through FourSquare API interface and arrange them as a dataframe for visualization. By merging data on London properties and the relative price paid data from the HM Land Registry and data on amenities and essential facilities surrounding such properties from FourSquare API interface, we will be able to recommend profitable real estate investments."
